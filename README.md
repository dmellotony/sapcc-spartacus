# CX Live

This repository demonstrates some customisations on top of [Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront). You can clone the repo and build, but the different branches can also be run in stackblitz.

## Demo 1: Getting started
The getting started demo shows:
1. pull in dependencies
2. include the `StorefrontModule`
3. Configure backend URL (OCC)
4. Add the root storefront component
5. Import the styles

**Note:** bootstrap is unfortunately published with a (peer)dependency to jquery, but we're not using it!
