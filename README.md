# CX Live

This repository demonstrates some customisations on top of [Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-commerce-spartacus-storefront). You can clone the repo and build, but there are also stackblitz links included. 

## Demo 1: Getting started
The first demo shows:
1. pull in dependencies
2. include the `StorefrontModule`
3. Configure backend URL (OCC)
4. Add the root storefront component
